# webserv

This project is to create a HTTP server in C++. Concepts about socket programming are introduced.

HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. With this project, we build a webserver from scratch, which can be tested with a real browser.

This is a group project completed by Q. Li & R. Bakker & G. Bouwen.
